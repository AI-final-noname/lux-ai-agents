* template: For each worker, if there is still space in the cargo, move to the nearest resource tile, otherwise move to the nearest friendly city tile. This is he example agent provided by official documentation.

* random-1: Each unit and city tiles randomly select an action from all the available actions, according to the weight.

## How to add new agents

Make a copy of the `template` directory, and modify the `agent.py` file. Other details can be seen in the [official documentation](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021/tree/master/kits/python).
